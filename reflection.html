    <p class="reflection">Responsive web design describes a web design approach that allows websites and pages to render (or display) on all devices and screen sizes by automatically adapting to the screen, whether it’s a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. The ultimate goal of responsive design is to avoid the unnecessary resizing, scrolling, zooming, or panning that occurs with sites that have not been optimized for different devices. Three technical elements for reactive web design require Fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. According to Kirkwood Jes, “Mobile phones and tablets are responsible for 56.74% of global internet usage.” The importance of reactive web design is also increasing as the use of portable mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablets increases.
        At first, my website was designed to look best on the PC/desktop. But when the screen was reduced, the tables and letters were strangely modified. So when building a reactive website, we chose to use a percentage rather than pixels for all sizes of the site, @media all and (max-width:767px){...Write style code } is used to execute the code when the screen is reduced to maximum width of 767 pixels  or less.
        I used also  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt; in my web page. This means that a &lt;meta&gt; viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. In addition, I used the same method to confirm that my website is a reactive web design.</br>
